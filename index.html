	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<p>I am currently a master's student studying ecological parasitology at the University of Vermont. My research jointly looks at the transmission dynamics of an apicomplexan parasite, *Monocystis* spp., and the population genetic structure of its invasive earthworm host, *Amynthas agrestis*.</a></p>
