	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<p>I am currently a master's student studying ecological parasitology at the University of Vermont. My research jointly looks at the transmission dynamics of an apicomplexan parasite, <i>Monocystis</i> spp., and the population genetic structure of its invasive earthworm host, <i>Amynthas agrestis</i>.</a></p>
